I am sitting down here an dreflecting on how my first month as an apprentice software developer at z01 has been.My mind drifts back to when this was just a wish ,, a fantasy that one day i would successfully be admitted here and it fills my heart with gladness to live my dream, but thats not all, thinkng of the state i was before joinng and the state i am rght now, incomparable,, for exmple for git i only know how to add, commit and push and small stuff here an dthere,, right now i can be able to merge, resolve conflicts, work on different branches and even do 2 comits with one commit message(make it sound fun and adventurous) as if thats not all, i am in a cohort with very ambitious and self driven individuals who are bold and fearless in chasing their dreams, make teamwork interesting as well as selfless in ofering assistance. As i continue working on my current project, i hope i meet my objectives, become better and make my time here worthwhile,, so much to learn and yeah, finish it off as dramatic and interesting as you can
